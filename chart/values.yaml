#### DevSpace Helm Chart ####
# This is a highly configurable Helm chart. For information on how to configure this file,
# take a look at the documentation: http://devspace.cloud/docs/chart/basics/devspace-helm-chart

# Components are independently scalable parts of your application
# Components can contain multiple containers which cannot be scaled independently from each other
components:
- name: default
  containers:
  - # Image tag will be automatically updated in runtime when running devspace deploy or devspace dev
    # The name used here has to match the name in .devspace/config.yaml under images.default.image, 
    # otherwise devspace is not able to replace it!
    image: yourusername/devspace
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "400m"
        memory: "500Mi"
        ephemeralStorage: "1Gi"
    # Environment variables
    env: []
    # Mount persistent volumes in this container
    volumeMounts: []
  # Expose your component via service
  # URLs will be connected if name=external and externalPort=80
  service:
    name: external
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
    - externalPort: 80
      # This is the container port that should be exposed through this service
      containerPort: 32127

# Define persistent volumes here
# Then mount them in containers above
volumes: []

# Defines image pull secrets
# DevSpace CLI will append all pull secrets which are automatically created
# More infos on: https://devspace.cloud/docs/cli/images/pull-secrets
pullSecrets: []
